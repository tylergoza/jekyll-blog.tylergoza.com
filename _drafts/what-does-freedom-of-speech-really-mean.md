What does free speech look like? When is it taken too far? How do we deal with speech we don't agree with? Is free speech ever dangerous? 
These are questions we face today.

Looking at the news and social media it seems that not everyone agrees on what is covered by free speech and what is not. It seems that as long as the person commenting on somethin that someone else says or does then the comments or actions are protected. If they disagree then it is suddenly a completely different story, the person is now evil. 
There seems to be this idea that you are not allowed to say or do anything offensive. The problem here is that nothing you say of substance can be inoffensive to everyone. If you comment on politics, someone is going to be offended. If you comment on current events it will offend someone, somewhere. 
Free speech is hard. Sometimes you will disagree or be offended when you see someone say or do something you disagree with. But part of living in a society is learning to work and live with people that you don't always see eye to eye with. I hear the objections now. "But there had to be a line." And yes, you are right. There is a line. Calls to actions and taking action, that is the line. 
## Calls to action

## Taking action
