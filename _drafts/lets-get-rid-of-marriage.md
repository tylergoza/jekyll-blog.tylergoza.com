title: Let's get rid of marriage.
---
I have a theory about how marriage should be handled under US law. I believe there is a way to respect individuals religious choices while granting the maximum amount of freedom to people with reguards to whom they wish to marry.  

Get rid of the concept of marriage as a legal status.  

Got your attention? Good.  

The problem in the US with marriage is how tightly coupled with religion it is. You are able to get married by an ordained minister, if you have the proper paperwork, and the Government will reconize it. Or you can go to a Judge and have them perform the ceremony. But the ceremony is still based on religion. Why is my religious view a matter for the state? Ultimately, it's not.  
I checked this out when my wife and I were married, the words spoken at the ceremony don't matter, at all. All that really matters, for the state, are the signatures of an officiante and witnesses. All that matters for the religious side are a small subset of words being spoken. So, why are the two connected?  
You can go have a ceremony performed that isn't reconized by the state. You can go to a judge and get married, and most churches will reconize that as valid, even if the judge is non-religious.  
Well, I think we should fix that. And it's not really hard to do.  

Here's a thought excercise for you, let's say that the government stops reconizing marriages the way they are currently done. Let's say that instead the government requires a contract between individuals, we'll call it a co-habitation contract. This contract spells out the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of the people involved and the method and circumstances of dissolution of the contract.  
Now as far as the government is concerned this is a business transaction. The only requirement is that everyone involved will have to be eligible to sign a contract (meaning they must be at least the "Age of Majority", which is 18 at the federal level). This means you don't care about the genders of the people involved, the number of people involved, or have to worry about kids being forced into marriage.  
This contract spells out things like what happens if you decide to have kids, who gains Power of Attorny if one of the people is incapacitated, how assets are divided if you break the contract, where people are burried, etc... It can be as complex or as simple as the people involved want. There can even be a basic form of the contract provided by the government that is a direct mirror of what the government believes the rights and priviledges are in current marriages (and by the way, that is a matter of a case-by-case basis when things go to court).  
The IRS and insurance companies would be required to reconize co-habitation documentation the same way they currently treat marriages and family units. If two or more are sharing expenses and responsibilities then they have a vested intrest in the other person/persons involved. So they should be able to file their taxes jointly (or at least a portion of their taxex) and should be able to share insurance. It only makes sense. 

One battle cry when the country was arguing over the definition of marriage a few years ago was "I didn't ask [them] to Civil Union me". Well now if you are non-religious you don't ask someone to marry you. You create this co-habitation contract and move on. If you are religious, then do the marriage thing, most likely your religion requires it.
